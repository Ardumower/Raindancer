V1.1.0
+ GotoArea Behaviour: TCheck2PerSignal was activated first, before TCheck2CoilSignalAreaX could rotate the mower while starting GotoArea => Changed position of TCheck2CoilSignalAreaX in selCheck2  and mower will always be rotated outside
with the right coil, before starting GotoArea Behaviour.
+ Somtetimes the mower does not rotate at the perimter because of uneven ground and wet gras. The mower stucks. => If both coils could not rotate inside, drive 30cm back and try again. If this is not working, an error is thrown. If this happens often, the mower is mayby to heavy at the front or the wheels has not enough grip.
+ If the perimeter signal was to strong, the signal recoginition could change inside to outside => This case will now be detected.
+ Issue#19: "Private-only" clause doesn't make much sense under GPLv3 => Removed
