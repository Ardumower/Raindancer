+ At the perimeter the robot drives now back instead of turning directly on the perimeterwire
+ removed zone recognition 
+ removed spiral
V1.2.0
+ Changed the code of the behavior tree: 
  Removed stack operation for running nodes. Now the tree recognize by itself, if a running node has to be cancelled.

  Action nodes can now have a condition: ActionCond, ActionMemCond.
  Now a Conditiondecorator node is availabe: ConditionDeco. 
  A waittimedecorator which queries the waittime from a variable on the blackboard is now available: WaitBBTimeDecorator.
  A decisiondecorator which queries a bool flag on the blackboard is now available: ExecuteOnTrue.
  A second Parallenode is introduces: ParallelUntilFail, Monitor.
  A filter is introduced, which is derivated from a Sequence : Filter.
  Introduced  Services which can be connected to Compositnodes: CompNodeService.  
  Introduced a Setup function which will be called only once before the tree starts running.
  Logging of changed leafs and control nodes during a tick is now available.
+ The decorator nodes with flags are now changed to ExecuteOnTrue nodes.
V1.1.1
Solved Issue #21 Unable to compile when CONF_DISABLE_CHARGINGSTATION is set to false
V1.1.0
+ GotoArea Behaviour: TCheck2PerSignal was activated first, before TCheck2CoilSignalAreaX could rotate the mower while starting GotoArea => Changed position of TCheck2CoilSignalAreaX in selCheck2  and mower will always be rotated outside
with the right coil, before starting GotoArea Behaviour.
+ Somtetimes the mower does not rotate at the perimter because of uneven ground and wet gras. The mower stucks. => If both coils could not rotate inside, drive 30cm back and try again. If this is not working, an error is thrown. If this happens often, the mower is mayby to heavy at the front or the wheels has not enough grip.
+ If the perimeter signal was to strong, the signal recoginition could change inside to outside => This case will now be detected.
+ Issue#19: "Private-only" clause doesn't make much sense under GPLv3 => Removed
